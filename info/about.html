    <h1>Mama & Papa's Story</h1>
        <div class="writing">
            <p>Mama and Papa’s love story began beneath the ancient oaks of an old enchanted forest, where they first discovered their shared passion for the arcane and the gourmet. As young lovers, they explored the mystical arts together, each learning that the true magic lies not just in the recipes they created but in the love that seasoned every dish. This bond, carefully aged and infused with whispers of the past, evolved into a culinary venture where tradition meets innovation. Mama, with her generations-old spoon, and Papa, with his charm for flavors, continue to weave their love into every meal they prepare, creating a legacy of romance and mystery that infuses the very walls of their restaurant.</p>

    <h1>Contact Information</h1>
        <div class="writing">
            <p>To reach Mama and Papa with inquiries, guests must engage in an old-world method of communication—through a Ouija board. As Mama and Papa have crossed to the other side, this is the only way to bridge the gap between the living and the ethereal realms where they now reside.</p>
