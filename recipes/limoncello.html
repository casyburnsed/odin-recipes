            <p>This cocktail is a spirited companion to any meal but pairs exceptionally well with dishes cloaked in richness and history, such as Mama’s Cursed Carbonara. The bright, bubbly nature of the spritz cuts through the dense flavors, ensuring the palate remains intrigued and refreshed from start to finish.</p>
