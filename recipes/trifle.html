                <li>1 large velvet cake, sliced into cubes (dark as a starless night)</li>
                <li>3 cups mixed berries (blackberries, raspberries, blueberries, cursed for extra flavor)</li>
                <li>2 cups heavy cream (whipped into soft peaks like the ones in their tumultuous romance)</li>
                <li>1/2 cup powdered sugar (as fine as the line between love and madness)</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract (extracted under a full moon)</li>
                <li>1/2 cup berry compote (simmered with the secrets of a thousand love stories)</li>
                <li>A few mint leaves (for a touch of freshness amidst the decay)</li>
                <li>Dark chocolate shavings (as bitter as an old argument)</li>
            </ul>
        <h2>Instructions</h2>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Layer the Shadows</strong>: Begin by layering cubes of velvet cake at the bottom of a large, clear glass trifle bowl. This base represents the foundation of their love—deep, rich, and ever-present.</li>
                <li><strong>Simmer the Secrets</strong>: Spoon a layer of the berry compote over the cake, letting the sweet and sour tales of yore seep into the crevices. Scatter a generous handful of fresh berries on top, each one bursting with stories best told in hushed tones.</li>
                <li><strong>Whip the Whispers</strong>: In a chilled bowl, whip the heavy cream with powdered sugar and vanilla until it forms soft, inviting peaks. This cream is like their love: sweet and enveloping, but with the potential to turn if not handled with care.</li>
                <li><strong>Build the Bewitchment</strong>: Gently spread a thick layer of whipped cream over the berries, smoothing it out to cover hidden secrets and buried tales. Repeat the layering—cake, compote, berries, and cream—until the bowl is nearly full.</li>
                <li><strong>Garnish with a Wink</strong>: To finish, sprinkle the top with dark chocolate shavings and a few mint leaves, like the final words in a love letter written in the dim light of their enchanted kitchen.</li>
                <li><strong>Let the Love Brew</strong>: Refrigerate the trifle for a few hours, allowing the layers to meld like a long marriage—full of flavor, surprises, and a touch of magic.</li>
